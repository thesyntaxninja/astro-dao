# AstroDAO

## Motivation

A group of astrophotographers and myself were interested in creating an NFT gated DAO. The concept was that the DAO would sell a memberhsip NFT for access. The proceeds from the original NFT drop would be used to fund a BFG (Big Freaking Telescope) that would be maintained by the founders of the DAO. The DAO members would then get a token drop and be able to vote on which deep space targets the telescope would shoot. We would then monetize the shots by selling the scientific data and dropping NFTs to the community and public.

This proof of concept was bootstrapped with a buildspace project.
